  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>I do not have completed instructions and drawings for
  a tandem kayak at this time. I hope to have tandem plans available sometime
  next summer. As soon as they are available they will be listed on my web
  page.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, I have a number of people who are adapting one
  of my single kayaks into a tandem at this time. They buy the solo kayak
  plans and I provide (at an additional cost of $30) a set of scaled and
  proportioned stations for a tandem kayak, with drawings suggesting the
  location of cockpits and hatches. I have not set up and faired these forms
  beforehand so there may be a little fairing necessary. Also I have not
  faired the lines in the deck between the cockpits. If this doesn't scare
  you then you can start working on a tandem of any of my single designs
  now. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>I can put your name on the list for notification when
  the tandem plans are completed if you wish.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE=+2>Building time ran about a year and a half (Georgian Bay
    tandem). It was worth the time spent and everyone who sees it thinks it's
    a work of art.</FONT></P>
