I seems to be reasonably fast, but maybe not as fast    as my Outer Island. </FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>I have since had a chance to paddle in a fair bit of wind    and some waves which is what I built the boat to paddle in. This morning    I went out with the wind blowing 20+ and 2-3 foot waves. Paddling into    the waves, the SS seemed to pitch less than my other boats and was drier    than I expected. The bow would plunge into the wave and rise up quickly    shedding water nicely. The recessed leading edge of the cockpit does seem    to prevent water from splashing you in the face. I found paddling perpendicular    to the waves very easy. The boat is solid as a rock and course corrections    are easy with a sweep of the paddle. I expected that with the large amount    of rocker in the bow and the fairly flat midship sections, downwind rides    would be squirrelly. I was proven wrong! </FONT></P>    <P><IMG SRC="images/shooting.star.images/ss.kk.shoulder.gif" WIDTH="360"    HEIGHT="275" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>    <P>&nbsp;</P>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The SS tracks really well when surfing down the face of    a wave. All kayaks will broach, but the SS can be straightened out easily    with a paddle sweep. I dropped the aft edge of the cockpit which makes    laying back on the deck easy when surfing and rolling. When I would be    surfing down a wave, the fixed rudder seemed to really do it's job, especially    with me laying back on the aft deck. I find this boat very easy to roll    and balance brace. </FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>I didn't think it was possible to have a kayak track    this well and be able to turn this easily. </FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yesterday I paddled with 2 friends that have longer SOF    Baidarkas. They are both very fast paddlers and I was concerned that I    would find the SS not fast enough to keep up with them. Again, I was wrong.    <B>This kayak is faster than I originally thought</B> and our &quot;I'm    not racing&quot; races found me doing just fine. My feeling is that the    large rocker in the bow and the very full sections forward don't help speed    in flat water, but when there is any texture to the water it seems to be    an asset. Compared to one of my friends Dyson 5.28 meter Baidarka, the    SS is much fuller in the bow, has more rocker in the bow and throws more    water in flat water. Overall, however, the SS holds it's own and does not    need a rudder as the Dyson boat does. I wonder what this boat would be    like with the bow less full and a touch less rocker? </FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>As it sits it is an excellent boat!! It not only looks    fast and sleek, it shines. </FONT></B></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Thanks again Rob for an awesome boat!! </FONT></B></P>    <P>&nbsp;</P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Ken Katz, Oakland CA</FONT></B></P>    <P><IMG SRC="images/shooting.star.images/ss.kk.shore.gif" WIDTH="451"     HEIGHT="223" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>    <P>August 26, 2007</P>    <P>I spoke with Ken today to ask if I might use this review which he sent    me a few years ago.
